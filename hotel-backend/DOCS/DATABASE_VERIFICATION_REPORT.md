## Conclusion

**🎉 ALL GUEST FUNCTIONS ARE WORKING CORRECTLY 🎉**

The initial concern about guests not saving to the database was **unfounded** or has been **resolved**. All comprehensive tests confirm that:

1. ✅ Guests ARE being created and saved to the database
2. ✅ All CRUD operations work perfectly
3. ✅ Check-in/check-out functions update the database correctly
4. ✅ Data persistence is reliable
5. ✅ All endpoints are functional
6. ✅ Database connection is stable

### Next Steps (Optional Improvements):
- [ ] Add data validation for email format
- [ ] Add room availability check before assignment
- [ ] Implement pagination for large guest lists
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Create activity logs
- [ ] Add booking system integration
