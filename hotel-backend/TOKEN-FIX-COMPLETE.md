# 🔧 AUTHENTICATION TOKEN FIX

## ✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED!

### The Real Issue

The app was **NOT sending the authentication token** with API requests!

**Error from logs:**
```
I/flutter: 📥 Response status: 401
I/flutter: ❌ Error: No token provided. Authorization denied.
```

### Root Cause

The `ApiService` class was **not a singleton**, which meant:
1. `AuthProvider` created one instance of `ApiService`
2. `AuthService` used that instance to set the token after login
3. `GuestService` created a **different instance** of `ApiService`
4. That different instance had **no token**, so all guest API requests failed!

### The Fix

✅ **Made `ApiService` a singleton** - Now there's only ONE instance shared by all services
✅ **Set token in `ApiService`** when user logs in via `AuthProvider`
✅ **Restore token** when app loads from storage
✅ **Clear token** when user logs out
✅ **Added debug logging** to track token usage

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. `lib/services/api_service.dart`
- ✅ Converted to singleton pattern
- ✅ Added getter for current token
- ✅ Enhanced debug logging to show when token is used

### 2. `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`
- ✅ Import `ApiService`
- ✅ Call `_apiService.setToken()` after successful login
- ✅ Call `_apiService.setToken()` when loading saved auth state
- ✅ Call `_apiService.clearToken()` on logout

### 3. `hotel-backend/controllers/guestController.js`
- ✅ Added detailed logging for guest creation
- ✅ Shows request body, validation, database operations

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Hot Restart Flutter App

The code has been fixed. Now you need to restart the app:

1. **Go to the Flutter terminal** (where it says "dart")
2. **Press `R`** (capital R) for hot restart
3. **Wait** for the app to reload

### 2. Re-Login

Since the token wasn't being saved properly before, you need to login again:

1. **Open the app** on your phone
2. **Click "Logout"** if you're already logged in
3. **Login again** with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
4. **Watch the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   ✅ Logged in successfully via API: [name]
   🔑 Token set in ApiService
   ```

### 3. Test Guest Registration

1. **Go to Guest Registration**
2. **Fill in the form:**
   - First Name: `John`
   - Last Name: `Doe`
   - Visit Purpose: `Testing`
3. **Click "Register Guest"**
4. **Watch the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   🔄 Creating guest: John Doe
   📡 POST: http://10.0.1.24:3000/api/guests
   🔑 Using token: [first 20 chars]...
   📥 Response status: 201
   ✅ Guest created successfully
   ```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
❌ Response status: 401
❌ Error: No token provided. Authorization denied.
❌ Failed to register guest

### After Fix:
✅ Response status: 201
✅ Guest created successfully
✅ Guest registered successfully!

## 🔍 How to Verify

### Check Backend Logs
You should see:
```
📥 Received guest creation request
📋 Request body: { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', ... }
✅ Generated guest ID: [uuid]
✅ Guest inserted into database
✅ Fetched created guest from database
📤 Sending success response
```

### Check Flutter Logs
You should see:
```
🔄 Creating guest: John Doe
📡 POST: http://10.0.1.24:3000/api/guests
🔑 Using token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
📥 Response status: 201
✅ Success: Guest created successfully
✅ Guest created successfully: [uuid]
✅ Guest saved to database via API
```

### Check Database
Run this to see guests in database:
```powershell
cd c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-backend
node -e "const db = require('./config/database'); db.query('SELECT first_name, last_name, status, created_at FROM guests ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5').then(([rows]) => { console.log('Recent guests:'); rows.forEach((r, i) => console.log(`${i+1}. ${r.first_name} ${r.last_name} - ${r.status}`)); process.exit(0); });"
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### If you still see "No token provided":

1. **Make sure you hot restarted** the app (press `R`)
2. **Logout and login again** to get a fresh token
3. **Check Flutter logs** for "🔑 Token set in ApiService"
4. **Check if token is being sent** - look for "🔑 Using token: ..."

### If you see "Connection timed out":

That's a different issue - that's the firewall blocking. But you should NOT see that error anymore because the connection IS working (you got 401, which means the request reached the server).

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When everything works:
- ✅ Login successful
- ✅ Token saved
- ✅ Guest creation returns status 201
- ✅ Guest appears in list immediately
- ✅ Guest saved to MySQL database
- ✅ Dashboard statistics update

**The fix is complete! Just restart the app and try again!**
