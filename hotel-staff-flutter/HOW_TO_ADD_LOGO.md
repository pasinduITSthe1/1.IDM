# ITSthe1 Logo - Add to Project

## 📍 Location Required

The logo file should be placed at:
```
c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-staff-flutter\assets\images\logo.png
```

## 🎨 Logo Details (from your image)

The ITSthe1 logo contains:
- Gray text: "its the 1"
- Gray text: "solutions" (below)
- Orange square with white "1" on the right side

## 📥 How to Add the Logo

### Option 1: Manual Copy
1. Save the ITSthe1 logo image from your attachment
2. Name it: `logo.png`
3. Copy to: `c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-staff-flutter\assets\images\logo.png`
4. Hot reload the app (press 'r' in the Flutter terminal)

### Option 2: Using PowerShell
If you have the logo saved somewhere, run this command:

```powershell
# Replace SOURCE_PATH with where your logo is saved
Copy-Item "SOURCE_PATH\itsthe1_logo.png" "c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-staff-flutter\assets\images\logo.png"
```

## ✅ Current Status

Looking at your screenshot, I can see:
- ✅ The app is running successfully
- ✅ Login screen displays "1.IDM"
- ✅ Subtitle shows "Identity Document Manager"
- ✅ Currently showing a building icon (fallback)
- ⏳ Needs: Actual ITSthe1 logo.png file

## 🔧 What Happens After Adding Logo

Once you place `logo.png` in the assets folder:
1. Press `r` in the Flutter terminal (hot reload)
2. The building icon will be replaced with the ITSthe1 logo
3. Logo will appear in a white container with shadow
4. Same layout as shown in your screenshot, but with the actual logo

## 📱 Expected Result

The login screen will show:
```
