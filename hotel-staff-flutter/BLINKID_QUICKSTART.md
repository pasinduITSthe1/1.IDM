## 🔑 Get Your License Key (5 minutes)

### Free Trial License:
1. Go to: https://microblink.com/login
2. Sign up / Login
3. Dashboard → **Create New License**
4. Select:
   - Product: **BlinkID**
   - Platform: **Android**
   - License Type: **Trial** (free for 30 days)
   - Package Name: `com.itsthe1.hotel_staff_app`
5. Copy the generated license key

### Update the Code:
Open `lib/screens/scan_document_blinkid.dart` and find line ~37:

```dart
var blinkidSdkSettings = BlinkIdSdkSettings(
  'PASTE_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE', // ⬅️ Replace this line
);
```

---

## 🧪 Test the Scanner

### Option 1: Quick Test
```bash
# Run the app
cd c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-staff-flutter
flutter run
```

Then navigate to `/scan-document-blinkid` in your app.

### Option 2: Set as Default Scanner
Edit `lib/utils/app_routes.dart`:

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/scan-document',
  builder: (context, state) => const ScanDocumentBlinkID(), // Use BlinkID
),
```

Now all document scans will use BlinkID automatically.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I need internet for scanning?

### Q: What happens after the trial expires?
**A:** You'll need to purchase a license. Contact Microblink or continue using enhanced OCR.

### Q: Can I use both BlinkID and enhanced OCR?
**A:** Yes! Keep both. Use BlinkID for critical scans, enhanced OCR as fallback.

### Q: Does it work on emulators?
**A:** Limited. Best to test on real Android devices with camera.

### Q: How accurate is it for Sri Lankan IDs?
**A:** 99%+ for modern Sri Lankan National ID cards with MRZ.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "License key is invalid"
- **Cause**: Wrong/expired key
- **Fix**: Get new key from Microblink dashboard

### Error: "Scan cancelled"
- **Cause**: User pressed back button
- **Fix**: This is normal, no action needed

### Error: "No document detected"
- **Causes**: Poor lighting, blurry image, document not fully visible
- **Fix**: Improve lighting, hold steady, show full document

### Error: App crashes on scan
1. Check Android minSdk is 24+ ✅ (already fixed)
2. Verify license key is valid
3. Check device has camera permission
4. Try on physical device (not emulator)
