## 📱 First Build Notes

**Important:** The first build takes 3-5 minutes because:
1. Flutter downloads required NDK version (27.0.12077973)
2. Gradle builds the Android app
3. ML Kit downloads OCR models

**Subsequent builds** will be much faster (30-60 seconds).

## ✅ What Works Now

- ✅ Project compiles without errors
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ Android configuration updated
- ✅ Camera permissions configured
- ✅ Orange theme applied
- ✅ OCR system ready
- ✅ MRZ detection enabled
- ✅ Auto-fill registration working

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Still Failing?

**Run clean build:**
```powershell
cd c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-staff-flutter
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d CPH2211
```

### Camera Not Working?

1. Check phone settings → Apps → hotel_staff_app → Permissions
2. Enable Camera permission manually
3. Restart the app

### OCR Not Extracting Data?

- Ensure good lighting
- Place document flat
- Fill frame with document
- Use manual entry if needed

### First Build Timeout?

The first build downloads ~500MB of dependencies:
- Be patient (5-10 minutes)
- Don't cancel the build
- Ensure stable internet connection

|------------|----------|-----|
| First Build | 5-10 min | NDK download, ML Kit setup |
| Second Build | 1-2 min | Most files cached |
| Hot Reload | <1 sec | Only changed files |
