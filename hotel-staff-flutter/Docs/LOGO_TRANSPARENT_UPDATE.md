# ✅ Logo Background Removed!

## Changes Made:

The logo now displays **WITHOUT** the white background container!

### Before:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  White Container    │
│  [Logo Image]       │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### After:
```
[Logo Image directly on orange background]
```

## How to See the Changes:

If your app is still running in the terminal:
1. Find the terminal where Flutter is running
2. Press **`r`** key (lowercase r)
3. This will hot reload the app
4. The logo will now show without the white background!

If the app is not running:
```powershell
cd c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-staff-flutter
flutter run -d CPH2211
```

## What Changed:

- ❌ Removed white background container
- ❌ Removed rounded corners
- ❌ Removed shadow
- ✅ Logo now displays directly on orange gradient
- ✅ Increased size slightly (200x140)
- ✅ Transparent background - blends with orange

## Result:

The ITSthe1 logo will appear cleanly on the orange gradient background without any white box around it. The gray "its the 1 solutions" text and orange "1" icon will stand out beautifully against the orange background!
