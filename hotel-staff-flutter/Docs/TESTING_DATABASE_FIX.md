## Expected Console Output

### On First App Launch (No Data):
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è No guests found in local storage
```

### After Registering First Guest:
```
‚úÖ Saved 1 guests to local storage
```

### After Check-In:
```
‚úÖ Saved 1 guests to local storage
```

### On App Restart (With Data):
```
‚úÖ Loaded 1 guests from local storage
```

### After Multiple Operations:
```
‚úÖ Saved 3 guests to local storage
‚úÖ Loaded 3 guests from local storage
```

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- Console shows save messages after operations
- Console shows load message on app start
- Guest counts match in dashboard stats
- All guest data is retained after restart
- Check-in dates and room numbers persist
- Status changes are saved correctly

### ‚ùå If Something's Wrong:
- No console messages ‚Üí Provider not initializing
- "No guests found" on restart ‚Üí Data not saving
- Guests disappear on restart ‚Üí Storage not loading
- Wrong counts ‚Üí Status values incorrect

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No console messages
**Solution:** Check that debug console is visible in your IDE

### Issue: Data not persisting
**Solution:** 
1. Check SharedPreferences permissions
2. Verify no errors in console
3. Try uninstalling and reinstalling app

### Issue: Wrong guest counts
**Solution:**
1. Check guest status values match: 'pending', 'checked-in', 'checked-out'
2. Verify filter logic in screens

## Running the App

### Development Mode:
```powershell
cd c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-staff-flutter
flutter run
```

### Debug Mode with Logs:
```powershell
flutter run --verbose
```

### Hot Reload:
- Press `r` in terminal to hot reload
- Press `R` in terminal to hot restart

### View Logs:
```powershell
flutter logs
```

## Clearing Data (For Testing)

If you want to start fresh and clear all saved data:

1. **Option 1: Uninstall app**
   - Uninstall from device/emulator
   - Reinstall with `flutter run`

2. **Option 2: Clear app data**
   - Android: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí 1.IDM ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Data

3. **Option 3: Add clear button (temporary):**
   ```dart
   // In dashboard, add a button to clear:
   final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
   await prefs.clear();
   ```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Fix is working if:**
1. Guests persist after app restart
2. Check-ins save with room numbers and dates
3. Check-outs save with checkout dates
4. Dashboard stats are accurate
5. All guest data is retained
6. Console shows save/load messages

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've verified the fix works:
1. Test with real device (not just emulator)
2. Test with more guests (10-20)
3. Test edge cases (special characters in names, etc.)
4. Consider implementing API sync for production
5. Add data export/backup feature
6. Implement data migration if needed

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output
2. Look for error messages
3. Verify SharedPreferences package is installed
4. Check file: `lib/providers/guest_provider.dart`
5. Review: `Docs/DATABASE_FIX.md` for implementation details
