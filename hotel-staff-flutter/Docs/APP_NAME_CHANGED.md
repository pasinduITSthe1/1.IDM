# ✅ App Name Changed to "1.IDM"

## Changes Made

I've successfully updated the app name from "Hotel Staff" to "1.IDM" in all the necessary places:

### 1. Android App Name (AndroidManifest.xml)
**File:** `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
```xml
android:label="1.IDM"
```
✅ This changes the name shown under the app icon on your device

### 2. App Title (main.dart)
**File:** `lib/main.dart`
```dart
title: '1.IDM',
```
✅ This sets the app title used by the system

### 3. Dashboard Header (dashboard_screen.dart)
**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`
```dart
const Text('1.IDM', ...)
```
✅ This updates the header text in the dashboard screen

## 📱 Where You'll See "1.IDM"

After the app installs, you'll see "1.IDM" in:

1. **App Drawer/Home Screen** - The name under the app icon
2. **Recent Apps** - When you switch between apps
3. **Settings > Apps** - In the apps list
4. **Dashboard Screen** - The header at the top of the app
5. **Task Switcher** - When viewing running apps

## 🎨 Complete Branding

Your app now has:
- ✅ **Icon:** Orange "1.IDM" logo
- ✅ **Name:** "1.IDM"
- ✅ **Color Scheme:** Orange (#FF8C42)

Perfect branding consistency! 🎉

## 🚀 Testing the Changes

The app is currently building and will install on your device automatically.

**To see the new name:**
1. Wait for the build to complete
2. Check your app drawer
3. The app should now show "1.IDM" under the icon

**Note:** If you still see the old name after installation:
- Uninstall the app
- Reinstall: `flutter run -d CPH2211`
- The launcher may cache the old name

## 💡 Additional Notes

If you ever want to change the app name again, edit these files:
1. `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Line with `android:label`
2. `lib/main.dart` - The `title:` property
3. `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart` - The header Text widget

For iOS (when you set it up):
- Edit `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Look for `CFBundleName` and `CFBundleDisplayName`

**Status:** ✅ Complete | App is building with new name
