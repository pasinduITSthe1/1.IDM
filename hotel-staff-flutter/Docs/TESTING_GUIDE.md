## 📋 Test Checklist

### Test 1: ✅ Blur Detection

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to scan screen
2. Intentionally move phone while capturing
3. Press capture button

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 Checking for motion blur...
📊 Blur variance: 87.23
❌ Image variance too low - BLURRY!
⚠️ MOTION DETECTED - Image too blurry!
```

**Expected Result:**
- Error message: "Image is blurry. Please hold still and try again."
- Camera stays active for retry
- No OCR processing happens

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

---

### Test 2: ✅ MRZ Zone Cropping

**Steps:**
1. Hold phone steady
2. Capture a clear image of passport
3. Watch terminal output

**Expected Output:**
```
📐 APK MRZ Zone Cropping...
Original: 3000x4000
🔍 Checking for motion blur...
📊 Blur variance: 234.56
✅ Image variance good - SHARP!
Cropping: bottom 35% (1400px)
✅ MRZ Zone cropped: 3000x1400
```

**Expected Result:**
- Image gets cropped to bottom 35%
- Only MRZ zone is processed
- Faster OCR processing

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

---

### Test 3: ✅ Enhanced Preprocessing

**Steps:**
1. Capture a clear passport image
2. Watch terminal for preprocessing logs

**Expected Output:**
```
🖼️ MRZ-optimized preprocessing...
📐 Original size: 3000x1400
📏 MRZ-optimized resize: 1200x560
🎨 Converted to grayscale
✨ APK-style contrast enhancement applied
🧹 Pre-sharpening noise reduction
🔪 APK-style advanced sharpening
🎯 APK adaptive thresholding...
📊 APK Otsu threshold: 142 (optimal)
⚫ APK-style adaptive thresholding applied
✅ MRZ preprocessing complete
```

**Expected Result:**
- Image resized to 1200px width
- Otsu threshold calculated (120-160 range)
- Clean black/white output

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

---

### Test 4: ✅ Dual OCR Analytics

**Steps:**
1. After preprocessing, watch OCR logs
2. Check both engines run

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 Starting DUAL OCR processing (ML Kit + Tesseract)...

📊 Dual OCR Analytics:
OCR Result:
  Total text: 124 chars
  Best engine: Tesseract
  
  ML Kit:
    - 89 chars
    - 245ms
    - 67.5% confidence
    
  Tesseract:
    - 124 chars
    - 1100ms
    - 91.2% confidence
```

**Expected Result:**
- Both engines run
- Tesseract usually has higher confidence
- ML Kit usually faster
- Best engine selected automatically

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

---

### Test 5: ✅ MRZ Parsing

**Steps:**
1. After OCR completes
2. Watch MRZ parsing logs

**Expected Output:**
```
🏭 Using Production MRZ Scanner...
🔍 Production MRZ Extraction Started
📄 Processing 124 characters of OCR text
📋 Extracted 2 potential MRZ lines
  MRZ Line 0: "P<USADOE<<JOHN<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<" (44 chars)
  MRZ Line 1: "1234567890USA7001011M2501011<<<<<<<<<<<06" (44 chars)
🔍 Trying TD-3 (Passport) format...
🎯 Attempting TD-3 parse:
  Line 1: P<USADOE<<JOHN<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  Line 2: 1234567890USA7001011M2501011<<<<<<<<<<<06
✅ TD-3 (Passport) MRZ parsed successfully
✅ MRZ Data Extracted:
  📋 documentType: Passport
  📋 firstName: JOHN
  📋 lastName: DOE
  📋 documentNumber: 123456789
  📋 dateOfBirth: 01/01/1970
  📋 expiryDate: 01/01/2025
  📋 sex: M
  📋 nationality: United States
```

**Expected Result:**
- MRZ lines detected
- Correct format identified (TD-3/TD-1/TD-2)
- All fields extracted
- Navigation to registration screen

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: App Crashes on Capture

**Possible Causes:**
- Out of memory
- Image too large
- Missing permissions

**Solutions:**
1. Check camera permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
2. Restart app
3. Check terminal for error logs

---

### Issue 2: "Image is blurry" Always Shows

**Possible Causes:**
- Threshold too strict (variance < 150)
- Camera out of focus
- Low lighting

**Solutions:**
1. Increase blur threshold in `_detectMotionBlur()`:
   ```dart
   final isBlurry = variance < 100; // Lower = more lenient
   ```
2. Ensure good lighting
3. Hold phone steady

---

### Issue 3: No MRZ Lines Detected

**Possible Causes:**
- MRZ not in frame
- Image too dark
- MRZ zone not cropped correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure bottom of document visible
2. Check cropping percentage (should be 35%)
3. Improve lighting
4. Check OCR text in terminal (should contain < symbols)

---

### Issue 4: MRZ Parsing Fails

**Possible Causes:**
- OCR text quality too low
- MRZ lines incomplete
- Wrong document format

**Solutions:**
1. Check OCR output in terminal
2. Verify MRZ lines are 44 chars (passport) or 30 chars (ID)
3. Look for pattern: `P<USA...` or `I<USA...`
4. Try different document formats

---

### If Tests Fail:
1. Note which test failed
2. Copy terminal logs
3. Check troubleshooting section

## 📞 Getting Help

### Debug Information to Collect:
1. **Terminal logs** (full output)
2. **Test device** (model, Android version)
3. **Document type** (passport, ID, etc.)
4. **Lighting conditions** (bright, dim, mixed)
5. **Image quality** (sharp, blurry, focused)

### Key Questions:
- Does blur detection work?
- Is MRZ zone cropping happening?
- Are both OCR engines running?
- What's the OCR text output?
- Are MRZ lines detected?
