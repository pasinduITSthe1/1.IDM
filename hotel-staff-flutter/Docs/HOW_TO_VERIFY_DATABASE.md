## Method 3: Test Persistence (THE PROOF) 🎯

This is the **ultimate test** to verify data is actually saved:

### Step-by-Step Test:

1. **Register a test guest:**
   - Dashboard → "New Registration"
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@demo.com
   - Phone: 1234567890
   - Register

2. **Check them in:**
   - Dashboard → "Check-In"
   - Enter room: 999
   - Check In → Confirm

3. **Verify it's visible:**
   - Dashboard should show:
     - Total: 1
     - Checked-In: 1
   - Note the room number: 999

4. **CLOSE THE APP COMPLETELY:**
   - Android: Swipe away from recent apps
   - iOS: Double-tap home and swipe up
   - Or stop from terminal: `Ctrl+C`

5. **RESTART THE APP:**
   ```powershell
   flutter run
   ```

6. **CHECK IF DATA PERSISTED:**
   - ✅ Dashboard still shows Total: 1, Checked-In: 1
   - ✅ Guest "Test User" still exists
   - ✅ Room number is still 999
   - ✅ Status is still "checked-in"
   - ✅ Check console shows: `✅ Loaded 1 guests from local storage`

### If All Above Pass:
**🎉 DATA IS BEING SAVED TO DATABASE!**

### If Data Disappears:
**❌ There's a problem** - Check troubleshooting section below

## Method 4: Check Using Android Studio Device Explorer

### For Android Devices:

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **View → Tool Windows → Device File Explorer**
3. Navigate to:
   ```
   /data/data/com.example.hotel_staff_app/shared_prefs/
   ```
4. **Find file:** `FlutterSharedPreferences.xml`
5. **Look for key:** `flutter.guests_data`
6. You should see JSON data with all your guests

### Example of what you'll see:
```xml
<string name="flutter.guests_data">
[{"id":"abc-123","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","status":"checked-in","roomNumber":"101",...}]
</string>
```

---

## Method 5: Programmatic Check (Code)

### Quick Test Code:

You can add this temporarily to any screen to check storage:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// Add this method anywhere for testing
Future<void> checkDatabase() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  final data = prefs.getString('guests_data');
  
  print('=== DATABASE CHECK ===');
  print('Data exists: ${data != null}');
  if (data != null) {
    print('Data length: ${data.length} characters');
    print('First 100 chars: ${data.substring(0, data.length > 100 ? 100 : data.length)}');
  }
  print('======================');
}
```

## Method 6: Check Console During Operations

### Expected Console Output Flow:

#### 1️⃣ **First App Launch (Clean Install):**
```
ℹ️ No guests found in local storage (first run or data cleared)
```

#### 2️⃣ **After Registering First Guest:**
```
✅ Saved 1 guests to local storage
📊 Data size: 412 characters
```

#### 3️⃣ **After Checking In That Guest:**
```
✅ Saved 1 guests to local storage
📊 Data size: 445 characters
```

#### 4️⃣ **After Registering Second Guest:**
```
✅ Saved 2 guests to local storage
📊 Data size: 824 characters
```

#### 5️⃣ **On Next App Restart:**
```
✅ Loaded 2 guests from local storage
📊 Data size: 824 characters
📝 Sample: John Doe - Status: checked-in
```

### Key Indicators:
- ✅ Data size increases as you add guests
