# üîß Database Persistence Fix

## Problem
Guests were not being saved to the database. When checking in guests, they would only exist in memory and disappear when the app restarted.

## Root Cause
The `GuestProvider` class in `lib/providers/guest_provider.dart` was storing guests only in a memory list (`_guests`) without any persistence mechanism. The data was never saved to local storage or a database.

## Solution Implemented
Added local storage persistence using `SharedPreferences` to automatically save and load guest data.

### Changes Made to `guest_provider.dart`:

1. **Added Required Imports:**
   ```dart
   import 'dart:convert';
   import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
   ```

2. **Added Storage Key:**
   ```dart
   static const String _storageKey = 'guests_data';
   ```

3. **Added Private Methods:**
   - `_saveToLocalStorage()` - Saves all guests to SharedPreferences as JSON
   - `_loadFromLocalStorage()` - Loads all guests from SharedPreferences on app start

4. **Updated All Guest Operations:**
   - `addGuest()` - Now saves to storage after adding
   - `updateGuest()` - Now saves to storage after updating
   - `checkInGuest()` - Now saves to storage after check-in ‚úÖ
   - `checkOutGuest()` - Now saves to storage after check-out
   - `loadGuests()` - Now loads from local storage on startup

## How It Works

### When Adding/Updating Guests:
1. Guest data is added/modified in memory
2. `_saveToLocalStorage()` is called automatically
3. All guests are serialized to JSON
4. JSON string is saved to SharedPreferences with key `'guests_data'`

### When App Starts:
1. Dashboard screen calls `loadGuests()`
2. `_loadFromLocalStorage()` is called
3. JSON string is retrieved from SharedPreferences
4. Data is deserialized back to Guest objects
5. Guests list is populated with saved data

## Benefits
‚úÖ **Persistent Storage** - Guests are now saved permanently to device storage  
‚úÖ **Automatic Backup** - Every operation automatically saves all data  
‚úÖ **No Data Loss** - Data survives app restarts and device reboots  
‚úÖ **Fast Access** - SharedPreferences provides quick read/write operations  
‚úÖ **Debug Logging** - Console logs show save/load operations for troubleshooting  

## Testing the Fix

### To Verify It's Working:

1. **Register a New Guest:**
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí New Registration
   - Fill in guest details
   - Tap "Register Guest"
   - Check console for: `‚úÖ Saved X guests to local storage`

2. **Check In a Guest:**
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Check-In
   - Enter room number
   - Tap "Check In"
   - Check console for: `‚úÖ Saved X guests to local storage`

3. **Restart the App:**
   - Close the app completely
   - Reopen the app
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Check console for: `‚úÖ Loaded X guests from local storage`
   - Verify all guests are still there with correct status

4. **Check Dashboard Stats:**
   - Stats should show correct counts
   - All guests should appear in Guest List
   - Checked-in guests should show in Check-Out screen

## Console Debug Messages

You'll see these messages in the debug console:

```
‚úÖ Saved 5 guests to local storage  // When saving
‚úÖ Loaded 5 guests from local storage  // When loading
‚ÑπÔ∏è No guests found in local storage  // First time app runs
```

## Important Notes

- Data is stored locally on the device using SharedPreferences
- The TODO comment for API integration remains for future backend connection
- When API is implemented, you can sync local storage with remote database
- Guest data includes: personal info, status, check-in/out dates, room numbers

## Future Enhancements

When implementing API integration:
1. Keep local storage as a cache
2. Sync with backend API on app start
3. Save to both local storage and API
4. Handle offline scenarios gracefully
5. Implement conflict resolution for sync issues

## Files Modified
- `lib/providers/guest_provider.dart` - Added persistence logic

## Dependencies Used
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` (already in pubspec.yaml)
- `dart:convert` (built-in JSON encoding/decoding)
