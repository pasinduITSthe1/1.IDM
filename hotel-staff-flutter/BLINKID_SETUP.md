# BlinkID Integration Guide

## Overview
BlinkID by Microblink is installed but requires a valid license key to work properly.

## Current Status
- ✅ Package installed: `blinkid_flutter: ^7.5.0`  
- ❌ License key required (trial or production)
- ⚠️ Alternative: Enhanced OCR implementation active

## Getting a BlinkID License

### Option 1: Free Trial (Recommended for Testing)
1. Visit: https://microblink.com/login
2. Create free account
3. Navigate to "Dashboard" → "Products" → "BlinkID"
4. Click "Create License"
5. Select platform: **Android**
6. Choose "Development" (free trial)
7. Copy the generated license key

### Option 2: Production License
- Contact Microblink sales for production pricing
- Typical cost: ~$1-3 per scan or monthly subscription
- Enterprise licenses available

## Implementation Steps

Once you have a license key:

### 1. Add License to Code
Edit `lib/screens/scan_document_blinkid.dart` line ~62:

```dart
MicroblinkScanner.setLicenseKey(
  'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE',  // Replace this
);
```

### 2. Update Routes
Edit `lib/utils/app_routes.dart`:

```dart
import '../screens/scan_document_blinkid.dart';  // Add this

// In routes array:
GoRoute(
  path: '/scan-document',
  builder: (context, state) => const ScanDocumentBlinkID(),  // Use BlinkID
),
```

### 3. Test the Integration
```bash
flutter run
```

Navigate to Guest Registration → Scan Document

## BlinkID Features

✅ **What BlinkID Provides:**
- Professional MRZ reading (99%+ accuracy)
- Auto-detection of document type (passport, ID, driver license)
- Extract ALL fields automatically:
  - Full name (first, middle, last)
  - Document number
  - Date of birth
  - Expiry date
  - Nationality
  - Sex/Gender
  - Address (if present)
  - Issue date
  - Document images (face photo, full document)
- Works with 2500+ document types worldwide
- Real-time scanning with live camera feedback
- Built-in document verification

## Current Alternative: Enhanced OCR

While waiting for BlinkID license, we've enhanced the ML Kit OCR:

**Active Implementation** (`scan_document_screen_v2.dart`):
- ✅ Optimized image preprocessing
- ✅ Pattern matching for common fields
- ✅ Works but less accurate than BlinkID
- ⚠️ Currently extracts 1-3 fields (document number mainly)

**Comparison**:

| Feature | Enhanced OCR | BlinkID |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Accuracy | 60-70% | 99%+ |
| Fields extracted | 1-3 | 10+ |
| Document types | Basic | 2500+ |
| Speed | 3-5 sec | 1-2 sec |
| Cost | Free | Paid |
| Reliability | Medium | High |

## Recommendation

**For Production**: Get BlinkID license
- Much better user experience
- Higher accuracy = fewer errors
- Faster scanning
- Professional solution

**For Development/Testing**: Current OCR is acceptable
- Free to use
- Good for prototyping
- Can upgrade to BlinkID later

## Troubleshooting

### BlinkID Errors:

**"License key not valid"**
- Check if key matches your bundle ID: `com.example.hotel_staff_app`
- Ensure key is for Android platform
- Verify key hasn't expired

**"Scanner failed to start"**
- Check camera permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
- Ensure device has camera
- Try cleaning and rebuilding: `flutter clean && flutter run`

**"No results from scanner"**
- Document might be poorly lit
- Try different angle/distance
- Ensure document is supported
