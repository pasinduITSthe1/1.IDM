# White Background Login Screen Update

## Changes Made

### Background
- **Before**: Orange gradient background (LinearGradient from primaryOrange to secondaryOrange)
- **After**: Clean white background (Colors.white)

### Text Colors
- **Title "1.IDM"**: Changed from white to `AppTheme.primaryOrange` for visibility on white background
- **Subtitle "Identity Document Manager"**: Changed from white with opacity to `Colors.grey[700]` for readability

### Logo
- **Size**: Increased from 200x140 to 250x100 for better proportions
- **Alignment**: Explicitly wrapped in `Center` widget for perfect centering
- **Error Fallback**: Updated to use orange icon on light orange background instead of white on transparent

### Login Card
- **No changes**: Remains white with shadow (already looked good)
- **Orange gradient**: Still used for selected mode chips

### Overall Design
- Modern, clean white background
- Orange accent color maintained for branding
- Better contrast and readability
- Professional appearance

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/login_screen.dart`

## Testing

- Adjusting width/height ratio
- Adding padding around logo
- Changing BoxFit property
