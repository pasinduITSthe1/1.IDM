# Database Connection Fix - Summary

## Problem
The hotel staff Flutter app was **NOT saving data to the MySQL database**. All data was only being stored in local device storage (SharedPreferences), which meant:
- ❌ Data was not persistent across devices
- ❌ No centralized database
- ❌ No data synchronization
- ❌ Backend API was not being used

## Root Cause
The Flutter app was never configured to communicate with the backend API. The `GuestProvider` and `AuthProvider` had placeholder comments like:
```dart
// TODO: Implement API call to QloApps
```

But no actual API integration was implemented.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created API Service Layer
**New Files:**
- `lib/services/api_service.dart` - Generic HTTP client wrapper
- `lib/services/guest_service.dart` - Guest-specific API calls
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Authentication API calls
- `lib/utils/api_config.dart` - Centralized API configuration

### 2. Updated Providers
**Modified Files:**
- `lib/providers/guest_provider.dart` - Now saves to database via API
- `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Now authenticates via API
- `lib/models/guest.dart` - Added `fromApiJson()` method for API response parsing

### 3. Added Hybrid Mode
The app now supports both online and offline modes:
- **Online Mode** (default): Saves to database via API
- **Offline Mode**: Falls back to local storage if API unavailable
- **Backup**: Always saves to local storage as backup

## Changes Made

### Backend (Already Working)
✅ MySQL database is operational
✅ Node.js API server is functional
✅ All endpoints tested and working
✅ Test script verified database writes

### Flutter App (Fixed)
✅ API service layer created
✅ Guest management integrated with API
✅ Authentication integrated with API
✅ Proper error handling added
✅ Fallback to local storage implemented
✅ Configuration file for easy setup

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start Backend
```powershell
cd c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-backend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Configure API URL
Edit `lib/utils/api_config.dart`:

**For Android Emulator:**
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2:3000/api';
```

**For Physical Device:**
1. Find your IP: `ipconfig`
2. Update: `'http://YOUR_IP:3000/api'`

### Step 3: Run Flutter App
```powershell
cd c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-staff-flutter
flutter run
```

## Verification

### Check Backend
```powershell
cd c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-backend
node test-db-insert.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Insert successful!
✅ Guest found in database
Total guests in database: X
```

### Check Flutter Console
Look for these messages when adding a guest:
```
🔄 Creating guest: John Doe
✅ Guest saved to database via API
✅ Saved X guests to local storage
```

### Check Database Directly
```sql
USE hotel_staff_db;
SELECT * FROM guests ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## Features

### ✅ Database Integration
- Saves guest data to MySQL database
- Real-time synchronization
- Persistent across devices
- Centralized data management

### ✅ Offline Support
- Falls back to local storage if API fails
- Auto-syncs when connection restored
- No data loss in offline mode

### ✅ Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks
- Detailed error logging
- User-friendly error messages

### ✅ Security
- JWT token authentication
- Secure API communication
- Password hashing (bcrypt)

## API Endpoints Used

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | User authentication |
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Register new staff |
| GET | `/api/guests` | Fetch all guests |
| POST | `/api/guests` | Create new guest |
| PUT | `/api/guests/:id` | Update guest |
| DELETE | `/api/guests/:id` | Delete guest |
| PUT | `/api/guests/:id/checkin` | Check-in guest |
| PUT | `/api/guests/:id/checkout` | Check-out guest |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix is complete and ready to test
2. 🔄 Start backend server
3. 🔄 Configure API URL for your device
4. 🔄 Run Flutter app
5. 🔄 Test login and guest creation
6. 🔄 Verify data in database

## Troubleshooting

### Backend not connecting?
- Check WAMP is running
- Verify MySQL service is started
- Test: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health`

### Flutter app can't reach backend?
- Check firewall settings
- Verify IP address is correct
- Ensure device and computer on same WiFi
- Review `lib/utils/api_config.dart`

### Data not saving?
- Check Flutter console for error messages
- Verify backend logs for errors
- Test database connection manually
- Ensure `_useApi = true` in `guest_provider.dart`
