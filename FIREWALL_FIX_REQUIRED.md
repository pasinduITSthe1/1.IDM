# 🚨 QUICK FIX - Database Not Working

## THE ROOT CAUSE 

You're using a **PHYSICAL DEVICE** but the app was configured for **EMULATOR**!

**Firewall is blocking the connection** between your phone and computer.

---

## ✅ I FIXED THE CODE (Already Done!)

1. ✅ Changed API URL from `10.0.2.2` to `10.0.1.24` (your WiFi IP)
2. ✅ Updated server to listen on all network interfaces
3. ✅ Server is running and ready

---

## 🔥 YOU NEED TO DO THIS (Firewall Fix)

### EASIEST WAY - Run the Batch File

1. Go to: `c:\wamp64\www\1.IDM\hotel-backend\`
2. Find: `add-firewall-rule.bat`
3. **Right-click** → **Run as administrator**
4. Click "Yes" when prompted
5. You'll see: ✅ Firewall rule added successfully!

### OR - Manual PowerShell Command

Open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Hotel Backend API" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000
```

---

## 📱 THEN - Restart Flutter App

In your Flutter terminal, press **`R`** (hot restart)

OR stop and run again:
```powershell
flutter run
```

---

## 🎯 LOGIN CREDENTIALS

```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

(NOT an email - just type "admin")

---

## ✅ IT WILL WORK AFTER YOU:

1. ☐ Add firewall rule (use the .bat file)
2. ☐ Hot restart Flutter app (press R)
3. ☐ Login with admin/admin123
4. ☐ See: ✅ Logged in successfully via API!

---

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY

After adding firewall rule, open PowerShell and test:

```powershell
curl http://10.0.1.24:3000/api/health
```

Should return:
```
{"success":true,"message":"Hotel Staff API is running"}
```

If you see this ✅ = Firewall is open, app will work!

---

## 📊 WHAT'S ALREADY DONE

✅ Backend server running on port 3000  
✅ Server listening on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)  
✅ API config updated to use WiFi IP (10.0.1.24)  
✅ MySQL database connected  
✅ Code changes complete  

❌ **ONLY THING LEFT:** Add firewall rule (use the .bat file!)

---

## 🎉 AFTER IT WORKS

Everything will save to database:
- Login authentication ✅
- Guest data ✅
- Check-in/out ✅
- All synchronized ✅

Demo mode will still work too (for offline use).

👉 Go to `hotel-backend` folder  
👉 Right-click `add-firewall-rule.bat`
