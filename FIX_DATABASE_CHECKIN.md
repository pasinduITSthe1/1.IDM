# ✅ FIX: Check-in Data Not Saving to Database

## Problem Discovered

When you checked in guests in the Flutter app, **the data was NOT being saved to the `guest_checkins` database table**. Instead, it was only being stored in the QloApps customer notes field. When you deleted customers from QloApps, all check-in records disappeared.

### Root Cause

**File:** `lib/providers/guest_provider.dart`  
**Method:** `checkInGuest()`

The check-in process was only updating QloApps customer notes:
```dart
await _qloAppsService.updateCustomer(
  int.parse(id),
  { 'note': 'Checked in on...' }
);
```

**It was NOT calling the hotel backend API** to save to the actual database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `guest_provider.dart`

Updated the `checkInGuest()` method to:
- ✅ Call the hotel backend API first (POST /api/hotel/checkins)
- ✅ Save check-in data to `guest_checkins` table
- ✅ Also update QloApps customer note (for reference)

**New Flow:**
```
Flutter checkInGuest()
    ↓
Call _qloAppsService.checkInGuest()
    ↓
POST to /api/hotel/checkins
    ↓
PHP: AdminHotelCheckinsController
    ↓
Save to guest_checkins table ✓
```

### 2. Added Methods to `qloapps_api_service.dart`

Three new methods added to handle hotel backend operations:

#### `checkInGuest()` - Record check-in
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> checkInGuest({
  required int customerId,
  required int bookingId,
  required int roomId,
  required String roomNumber,
  required String checkInTime,
  required String checkInMethod,
  required String checkedInBy,
  required String notes,
})
```

#### `checkOutGuest()` - Record checkout
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> checkOutGuest({
  required int customerId,
  required String checkOutTime,
  required double totalAmount,
  required String paymentStatus,
  required String paymentMethod,
  required String notes,
})
```

#### `recordPayment()` - Record payment
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> recordPayment({
  required int customerId,
  required double amount,
  required String paymentMethod,
  required String notes,
})
```

## Database Operations Now Enabled

✅ **Check-ins**: Saved to `guest_checkins` table  
✅ **Checkouts**: Saved to `guest_checkouts` table  
✅ **Payments**: Saved to `guest_payments` table  
✅ **Logs**: All operations logged in `guest_logs` table

## How to Test

1. **Restart or hot-reload Flutter app**
   ```
   flutter hot-reload (R key)
   ```

2. **Create and check in a guest**
   - Click "Scan ID/Passport"
   - Fill in form (or scan document)
   - Enter room number
   - Click "Check-In"

3. **Verify in database**
   - Open phpMyAdmin
   - Navigate to `1.IDM_db` → `guest_checkins`
   - Should see new check-in record with:
     - id_customer
     - id_room
     - check_in_time
     - status: 'checked_in'
     - created_at timestamp

4. **Verify data persists**
   - Delete customer from QloApps (or refresh list)
   - Check-in record stays in database ✓

## Backend Endpoints

These endpoints now receive check-in/checkout/payment data:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/hotel/checkins` | POST | Record guest check-in |
| `/api/hotel/checkouts` | POST | Record guest checkout |
| `/api/hotel/payments` | POST | Record payment |
| `/api/hotel/guests/{id}/timeline` | GET | Get guest activity log |
